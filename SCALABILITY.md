### Minimum Viable Plasma
- Minimum Viable Plasma (MVP) is a design for extremely simple UTXO based chains
- MVP specification enables high-throughput payment transactions, 
- MVP does not support more complicated constructions like scripts or smart contracts.
- MVP relies on confirmation signatures
- Users need to sign a signature before making a transaction, 
- Users need to wait to see the transaction included in a valid block, and then sign another signature. 
- These second signatures must also be included within a plasma block, reducing block space available for more transactions
