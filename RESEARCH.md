** Data Availability
- Data Availability is Permissionless Ability to Reconstruct State
- Rollups are data availability + execution check

** Optimism
- Optimism does execution check using fault proofs
- L2 needs to ensure at least one honest actor can reconstruct the state
- L2 needs to be fault tolerant even when there are bad sequencers

** Roadmap to Modular Chains
- PoW to PoS > Monolithic chain to Modular chain
- Modular chain consisting of separate beacon layer and execution layer

** ZK Systems
- ZK Systems scale computation, not communication
