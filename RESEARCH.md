## Data Availability
- Data Availability is Permissionless Ability to Reconstruct State
- Rollups are data availability + execution check

## Optimism
- Optimism does execution check using fault proofs
- L2 needs to ensure at least one honest actor can reconstruct the state
- L2 needs to be fault tolerant even when there are bad sequencers

## Roadmap to Modular Chains
- PoW to PoS > Monolithic chain to Modular chain
- Modular chain consisting of separate beacon layer and execution layer

## Nature of Rollup Systems
- ZK Systems scale computation, not communication
- Sequencer puts call data storage into data layer
- Sequencer puts Validity / Fault Proofs into Settlement layer

## Capital Cost
- Capital cost dominates all the other cost in proof of stake systems

## Economics of Middleware
- Oracles, Bridges, Sidechains etc.
- Merge Mining v/s Restaking
